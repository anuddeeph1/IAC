    policies.kyverno.io/description: >-
      Restricting SSH access prevents unauthorized users from gaining direct access to the underlying nodes of the Kubernetes cluster. 
      By limiting access to specific trusted networks or entities, organizations can reduce the 
      risk of potential security breaches and unauthorized modifications to the cluster infrastructure. 
      If `ec2SshKey` is specified and `sourceSecurityGroups` is not specified for the EKS Node Group, 
      either port 3389 for Windows or port 22 for other operating systems will be opened on the worker nodes to the Internet which can lead to unauthorized access
